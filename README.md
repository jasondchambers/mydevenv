# My Development Environment

Firstly, tools are a personal choice. What works for some my not work for others. If what you use works - that's great. I do encourage you to on occastion, reflect on your developer workflows and invest in how you might make things a little better, a little faster, and maybe a little prettier :-) 

For what it's worth however here's what my development environment looks like.

### Highlights

My development environment has changed quite a lot over the past year. My philosophy is:

1. Aesthics - must look pretty
2. Minimal deviations from standard configurations - Must be low maintenance (e.g. Use Lazyvim)
3. Consistency - across both Omarchy and macOS
4. Efficiency and speed - use the keyboard as much as possible
5. Cost - Use Gemini CLI for coding AI assistance
6. Easier to get into and stay in a flow state

#### O/S

Omarchy is now used as my primary OS. I still use macOS for some workflows and so require
consistency for when I need to do some things on macOS. 

#### IDE

Cursor and VS Code are no longer used. Instead, I use Neovim, Lazygit and Gemini CLI. I've
also introduced lazygit into my workflows.

#### Terminal

I've standardized on Alacritty as it is available on both Omarchy and macOS.
