# My Development Environment

Firstly, tools are a personal choice. What works for some may not work for others. If what you use works - that's great. I do encourage you to on occastion, reflect on your developer workflows and invest in how you might make things a little better, a little faster, and maybe a little prettier :-) 

Here's what my development environment looks like, including dot-files and associated install scripts. It's published mostly for myself, but if you find value in it too, that's great.

### Highlights

My development environment has changed quite a lot over the past year. My philosophy is:

1. Aesthetics - must look pretty
2. Minimal deviations from standard configurations - Must be low maintenance (e.g. Use Lazyvim)
3. Consistency - across both Omarchy and macOS to reduce friction as I switch between the two
4. Efficiency and speed - use the keyboard as much as possible
5. Cost - Use Gemini CLI for coding AI assistance (as of time of writing, Gemini has a good balance of performance and value)
6. Optimal - Easier to get into and stay in a flow state

#### O/S

Omarchy is now my preferred primary OS. I still use macOS for some workflows and so require
consistency for when I need to do some things on macOS. Eventually, I intend to migrate away 
from macOS (after 20 years).

#### IDE

Cursor and VS Code are no longer used. Instead, I use Neovim, Lazygit and Gemini CLI. I've
also introduced lazygit into my workflows.

#### Terminal

I've standardized on Alacritty as it is available on both Omarchy and macOS.
